            <p>There's a total of four people in my immediate family including myself.
            My mom, dad, and my little brother Andrew.</p>

            <font color="black">
            <p>Both of my parents originally lived in Azores, Portugal. My dad moved to Massachusetts when he was 12 years old, and my
            mom had moved to Massachusetts when she was 18. All my life my parents have been talking around our house in English and Portuguese. This had developed my brother
                and I in learning the language ourselves.</p>

<p> My younger brother Andrew is currently 16 years old, is my only other sibling. My brother and I do everything together, from hiking in our woods,
    watching stupid YouTube videos, to just being by each other's side whenever we need one another.</p>
